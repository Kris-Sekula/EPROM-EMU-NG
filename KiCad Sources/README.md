KiCad project files.

One note: Most of the pictures on my page and here are based on ver v1.0 of the PCB. After I built the first 5 prototypes, I discovered an issue with the PCB layout, one of the shift registers (U11) was getting onto a CMOS latch-up state, even though I had a few bypass caps around the PCB, I was still occasionally getting the issues. I fixed the prototypes by "bodging" a few connections at the bottom of the pcb.

In version 1.4 I re-routed the power and improved the PCB design, so what you see here on GitHub is PCB v1.4 desing files, but most pictures are still v1.0
