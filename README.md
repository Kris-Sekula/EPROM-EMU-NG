# EPROM-EMU-NG
EPROM Emulator Project with Arduino Nano, read more on [https://MyGeekyHobby.com](https://mygeekyhobby.com/2020/07/05/eprom-emulator/)

I have assembled devices and kits listed on [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/sch/avr4sale/m.html?_nkw=&_armrs=1&_ipg=&_from=)

As people start building those, I encourage everyone to help creating updated firmware, software and collaborate here, report Issues if needed or contact me directly.

I get my PCBs from:
